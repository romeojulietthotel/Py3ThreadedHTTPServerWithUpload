|Multi-threaded http download/upload server.|
=============================================

BaseHTTPServer that implements the standard GET and HEAD requests.

This is wide open and meant for trusted environments only.
The purpose is to have an easy way to share files on a LAN with people
you trust.

It works but it's not perfect. But good enough.
